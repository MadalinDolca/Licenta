# Mobile app for promoting and licensing artists' works

This is an app that I developed for my undergraduate thesis. Its purpose is to offer the artists the ability to upload and distribute their music in a controlled manner via the other users of this app by implementing a usage request, evaluation and license generating mechanism to offer the applicants the permission of complete or partially use of the desired audio content.
